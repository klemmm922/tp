# Practices - Data engineering

Have a stackoverflow account : https://stackoverflow.com/

Have a github account : https://github.com/

And a github repo to push your code.

## Fork the repo on your own Github account
* https://github.com/polomarcus/tp/fork

## Docker and Compose
Take time to read and install

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/
```
docker --version
Docker version 20.10.14
```

https://docs.docker.com/compose/
```
docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.29.2
```


## TP1 - [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
### Communication problems

### Why Kafka ?
https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#introduction

Answer these questions with what you can find on the documentation :

- What problems does Kafka solve ?

- Which use cases ?

- What is a producer ?

- What is a consumer ?

- What are consumer groups ?

- What is a offset ?

- Why using partitions ? 

- Why using replication ?

- What are  In-Sync Replicas (ISR) ?

### Try to install Kafka without docker
https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#gettingStarted

### Use kafka with docker
Start multiples kakfa servers (called brokers) by downloading a docker compose recipe : 
* https://github.com/conduktor/kafka-stack-docker-compose#single-zookeeper--multiple-kafka

Check on the docker hub the image used : 
* https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka


### Verify
```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS                                                                                  NAMES
b015e1d06372   confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1       "/etc/confluent/dockâ€¦"   10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds   0.0.0.0:9092->9092/tcp, :::9092->9092/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9999->9999/tcp, :::9999->9999/tcp   kafka1
(...)
```

### Getting started with Kafka
1. Connect to your kafka cluster with 2 command-line-interface (CLI)

Using [Docker exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/#description)

```
docker exec -ti my_kafka_container_name bash
> pwd
```

```
> kafka-topics 
# will give you help to use this command
> kafka-topics --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 
# will give you an error
```
Read this blog article to fix `Broker may not be available.` error : https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/

Pay attention to the `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` config from the docker-compose file.

2. Create a "mailbox" - a topic with the default config : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_createtopic
3. Check on which Kafka broker the topic is located using `--describe`
5. Send events to a topic on one terminal : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_send
4. Keep reading events from a topic from one terminal : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_consume
* try the default config
* what does the `--from-beginning` config do ?
* what about using the `--group` option for your producer ?
6. stop reading
7. Keep sending some messages to the topic

#### Partition 
1. Check consumer group with `kafka-console-consumer` : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_consumer_group
* notice if there is [lag](https://univalence.io/blog/articles/kafka-et-les-groupes-de-consommateurs/) for your group
2. read from a new group, what happened ?
3. read from a already existing group, what happened ?
4. Recheck consumer group

#### Replication - High Availability
1. Increase replication in case one of your broker goes down : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs
2. Stop one of your brokers with docker
3. Describe your topic, check the ISR (in-sync replica) config : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design_ha
4. Restart your stopped broker
5. Check again your topic
